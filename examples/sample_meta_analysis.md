## Abstract

While evidence supports exercise as beneficial for mental health, optimal intensity remains debated. This meta-analysis of 89 RCTs (n=8,432) examines dose-response relationships between exercise intensity and mental health outcomes. Results reveal non-linear relationships with moderate intensity (40-60% VO2max) showing optimal benefits for depression, while higher intensities (>70% VO2max) may be superior for anxiety in certain populations.

## 1. Introduction

Previous research has established that exercise improves mental health, but the question of optimal intensity remains controversial. Some researchers advocate for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), citing time efficiency and robust physiological adaptations. Others argue that moderate continuous exercise is more sustainable and equally effective.

### 1.1 Research Questions

1. What is the dose-response relationship between exercise intensity and depression outcomes?
2. Does exercise intensity differentially affect anxiety versus depression?
3. Are there population-specific intensity recommendations?

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Search Strategy

Systematic search of PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO (2015-2024) using terms: "exercise intensity" AND ("depression" OR "anxiety" OR "mental health") AND "randomized controlled trial."

### 2.2 Inclusion Criteria

- RCTs with clearly defined intensity parameters
- Adult participants with measurable mental health outcomes
- Minimum 4-week intervention duration

### 2.3 Statistical Analysis

Random-effects meta-regression with intensity as continuous moderator. Non-linear relationships tested using restricted cubic splines.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Overall Effects

All exercise intensities improved mental health outcomes compared to control:
- Light intensity (<40% VO2max): SMD = -0.31 (95% CI: -0.45 to -0.17)
- Moderate intensity (40-60% VO2max): SMD = -0.58 (95% CI: -0.71 to -0.45)
- Vigorous intensity (60-80% VO2max): SMD = -0.52 (95% CI: -0.68 to -0.36)
- High intensity (>80% VO2max): SMD = -0.47 (95% CI: -0.65 to -0.29)

### 3.2 Depression-Specific Findings

**Finding 1:** Moderate intensity exercise produced the largest effect on depression (SMD = -0.62), significantly greater than high intensity (SMD = -0.41, p = 0.03).

**Finding 2:** The dose-response curve showed diminishing returns above 60% VO2max.

**Finding 3:** Duration moderated the intensity effect—longer durations (>12 weeks) showed more pronounced intensity differences.

### 3.3 Anxiety-Specific Findings

**Contrasting Finding:** For anxiety, higher intensities (>70% VO2max) showed larger effects (SMD = -0.55) compared to moderate intensity (SMD = -0.43), though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.12).

### 3.4 Population Subgroups

| Population | Optimal Intensity | Effect Size |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Clinical depression | Moderate | -0.71 |
| Subclinical depression | Any | -0.45 |
| Generalized anxiety | Moderate-to-vigorous | -0.52 |
| Older adults (>65) | Light-to-moderate | -0.48 |
| Young adults (18-35) | Vigorous | -0.61 |

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Interpretation

Our findings suggest that the "more is better" assumption does not hold for exercise and mental health. The inverted-U relationship observed for depression aligns with the Goldilocks principle—too little or too much may be suboptimal.

### 4.2 Mechanisms

Potential explanations for intensity-differential effects:
1. **Moderate intensity** allows for maintained conversation, possibly enhancing social/psychological benefits
2. **High intensity** may trigger excessive cortisol, counteracting some benefits
3. **Perceived exertion** may matter more than objective intensity

### 4.3 Conflicting Evidence

Several studies challenge our main findings:
- Gordon et al. (2023) found HIIT superior to moderate exercise for depression
- Stubbs et al. (2022) found no intensity effect in clinical populations
- Schuch et al. (2024) reported higher intensities needed for treatment-resistant depression

### 4.4 Limitations

- Heterogeneous intensity definitions across studies
- Self-reported mental health measures in many trials
- Limited long-term follow-up data
- Potential publication bias toward positive findings

## 5. Conclusions

Exercise intensity significantly moderates mental health outcomes. While moderate intensity appears optimal for depression, the picture is less clear for anxiety and may depend on population characteristics. Clinicians should consider individual preferences and capabilities when prescribing exercise intensity.

## Clinical Recommendations

1. **For depression:** Start with moderate intensity; adjust based on response
2. **For anxiety:** Consider higher intensities if tolerated; monitor for overtraining
3. **For older adults:** Prioritize consistency over intensity
4. **For young adults:** Higher intensities may enhance engagement and efficacy

## Key Takeaways

- **Consensus:** Exercise of any intensity improves mental health
- **Consensus:** Moderate intensity is generally safe and effective
- **Disagreement:** Optimal intensity for anxiety remains unclear
- **Disagreement:** Whether HIIT is superior for certain populations
- **Open question:** Long-term adherence at different intensity levels
- **Open question:** Individual genetic/psychological factors affecting intensity response
